# FlowScript - The Concise Calculus Programming Language

## What is FlowScript?

### FlowScript is a Hyper-Concise and Dataflow-Oriented language, born from the frustration of repetitive operations in imperative programming.

## Features

- **Dataflow Paradigm**: Natural expression of data transformations
- **Hyper-Concise Syntax**: Minimal boilerplate, maximum expressiveness
- **Simple Execution Model**: Clear data flow from input to output
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Full support for mathematical expressions
- **Nested Expressions**: Complex computations with clean syntax

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qdyg-vn/FlowScript
cd FlowScript
```

## How to run fscc file?

python main.py <file_name>.fscc

### Example:

```python
python main.py main.fscc
```

## Philosophy

FlowScript eliminates imperative boilerplate by making dataflow the primary concern.
Instead of worrying about variables and assignment, you focus on how data transforms through operations.
